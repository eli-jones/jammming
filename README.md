# Getting Started with Jammming

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this project. This is part of Codecademy's Front End Web Design certification course. The goal is to create an app that uses Spotify API to allow users to search for a song and add it to a playlist that can then be save to their account.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Spotify API

### What I learned

This project really tested my Javascript knowledge and forced me to use the terminal more than I am inclined to naturally. This is also my first interaction with an API, which was super informative and has given me a solid basis for that process that I know I can use later.

### Continued development

I would like to return this project. I want to add an animation that will play when the page first loads (similar to the current animation that plays on the logo), add a loading animation, add a loading screen while the playlist is saved to Spotify, a method that checks if a user is signed in to Spotify before they can search. I did all my testing up to this point manually, so I also want to really build out some automatic test methods, but I need some more reading and practice with Jest to get my head wrapped around that.
